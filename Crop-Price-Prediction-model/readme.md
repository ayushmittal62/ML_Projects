# Crop Price Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict crop prices based on various factors such as historical data, weather conditions, and other agricultural inputs. The aim is to provide insights into future crop prices to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, feature scaling, and splitting data into training and testing sets.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes Random Forest Regressor to predict crop prices.
- **Model Evaluation**: Measures performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Visualization**: Plots results to visualize the prediction accuracy.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing and model training.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for building and evaluating models.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Installing Required Libraries
